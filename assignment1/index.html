                <p>The first thing I noticed about the interactive web project from the interactive experience was the design concept used in the web project. The design concept used in this interactive web project is inspired by the Advent Calendar. Using an Advent calendar as its core concept with numbered boxes containing small gifts or treats, users click on each box to interact with it and explore its contents. </p>

                <p>I invested the most time into the interactive experience for the Advent Calendar part, which is the key concept of the website. When you click on a numbered box, it opens like a door, revealing hidden content. Object elements called Hidden Treats are placed in the boxes, and text is written in some boxes. The object elements could be interacted with in a variety of ways, such as moving them using the mouse or placing them in a new location.</p>
