                <p>The first thing I noticed about the interactive web project from the interactive experience was the design concept used in the web project. The design concept used in this interactive web project is inspired by the Advent Calendar. Using an Advent calendar as its core concept with numbered boxes containing small gifts or treats, users click on each box to interact with it and explore its contents. </p>

                <p>I invested the most time into the interactive experience for the Advent Calendar part, which is the key concept of the website. When you click on a numbered box, it opens like a door, revealing hidden content. Object elements called Hidden Treats are placed in the boxes, and text is written in some boxes. The object elements could be interacted with in a variety of ways, such as moving them using the mouse or placing them in a new location.</p>

            <p>The most common interaction behaviour on the website was the mouse interaction experience. The most basic clicks and scrolls were used to navigate pages and actions, and most of the interaction on this website was through object elements. When you mouse over an object element to move the mouse over the element and focus on the object element, a shadow appears on the object element and you can experience interaction through a shaking animation. Additionally, I was able to experience customising interactions by using drag and drop to move and align object elements using the mouse.</p>

         <div id="box10">
            <p>The main goal of the interactive experience through this website is to encourage users to become interested in MyoungAe Kim's portfolio through interaction. This intention was to encourage user interaction, resulting in more natural and effective communication. She used the Advent Calendar to engage users and encourage them to stay on the website longer through an interactive experience. This had the effect of making users interested not only in the website's Advent Calendar but also in her portfolio.</p>
         </div>
         <div id="box11">
            <p>To deliver on the basic goal of these interactive experiences, it is important that the interactive experience helps users achieve their goals efficiently and quickly. In this regard, MyoungAe Kim designed the website with an intuitive interface that users can easily understand and use to quickly respond to user requests and easily access necessary information or functions. The main goal of the interactive experience was conveyed through an interactive experience that was easy for users to understand and use through an intuitively designed interface and simple navigation.</p>

            <p>This interactive website is designed for short-term engagement, not ongoing interaction. Designing for long-term engagement requires updates to keep users coming back to your website, either by providing a variety of features to encourage multiple visits or by updating them with new information. However, the website's largest interactive experience, the Advent Calendar, appears to be a one-time experience. Even if you refresh, the hidden objects in the Advent Calendar are provided in the same location, so it feels like it is not enough to encourage continuous user participation.</p>

            <p>This website does not provide any mechanisms or features to encourage users to repeatedly visit or engage with the website. This website was created for MyoungAe Kim's portfolio and was last updated on December 21, 2023. If she adds new work, the user may come back to view her portfolio, but it doesn't provide progress tracking or a personalised dashboard for her work. So I think that users will not return to the website repeatedly.</p>

                <p>As this website is designed with the Advent Calendar as a motif, it has a physical structure similar to the Advent Calendar. The Advent Calendar is structured in such a way that when you open the box corresponding to the date from the 1st to the 25th, a gift such as a small snack is randomly placed, making it fun to wait for Christmas while receiving a new gift every day. This website was inspired by the Advent Calendar's design structure and designed an interface similar to the Advent Calendar with numbered boxes. And since the Advent Calendar was created to celebrate Christmas, this website continues in that spirit. Objects related to Christmas were placed in numbered boxes, and objects shaped like desserts were used to create an experience similar to the Advent Calendar, which features small snacks.</p>

                <p>Mimicking the layout of Advent Calendar, the website encourages interactive experiences that drive user action so that users can use the website like Advent Calendar. By encouraging users to click on numbered boxes to interact with and explore the content, the website feels like an Advent Calendar experience. This allows the website to use the Advent Calendar feature to encourage people to stay on the website, get interested in and explore her portfolio.</p>

            <div id="box21">
                <p>This website brings back memories of experience with the Advent Calendar. This can be divided into users who have experience with Advent Calendar and users who have not. For users who have experienced the Advent Calendar, it brings back memories of the past and the excitement of opening boxes with dates from the 1st to the 25th to discover small gifts that were randomly inside. On the other hand, users who have not experienced the Advent Calendar have no memory of the Advent Calendar, so new experiences can induce interesting emotions. In both cases, it can induce a positive response from users, making them feel familiar or interesting, thereby increasing participation and enjoyment.</p>

                <p>The most disappointing aspect of my interactions with this website is that it is a one-time experience. Interaction with the Advent Calendar is an interesting element. However, it is boring to experience continuously. Even if I refresh the website, the objects inside each numbered box are always placed in the same location rather than being updated to a new location. Therefore, I did not feel the need to experience this interaction on an ongoing basis. The interactive experience through the Advent Calendar is the biggest advantage of this website, but once you experience it, the user will lose interest, making the website less attractive.</p>

            <div id="box26">
                <p>The most satisfying part of the interactive experience on this website is its intuitive design and functionality. The website is designed with an intuitive interface that users can easily understand and use so that they can easily access the information or functions they need without unnecessary features. This made it easy for me to understand and use the website without having to look at it further or understand its features. Since this is an important factor in determining how efficient and fast the process of achieving a user's goal is, being able to easily access the necessary information or functions was satisfactory in terms of the interactive experience.</p>
